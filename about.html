    Our Mission, Vision, and Core Values 🎯</h2>
  <div class="content">
     <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      At its core, <strong>Baro</strong> is about returning commerce to its roots — people trading directly with people.
      Before big-box stores and corporate rental chains, borrowing and lending were personal. You could borrow what you needed
      and lend what you didn’t — as long as you knew someone who had it.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Baro</strong> bridges that gap. We make peer-to-peer lending possible without needing prior connections and with
      as little red tape as possible. Our goal is to enable simple, safe, and transparent exchanges while taking as little as
      possible from the financial transaction itself.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-center text-blue-600">The Peer-to-Peer Revolution 🌍</h2>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The success of today’s leading peer-to-peer platforms shows how powerful this model can be:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6" style="text-align: left;">
      <li><strong>Airbnb</strong> became one of the world’s most valuable vacation rental platforms — without owning a single property.</li>
      <li><strong>Turo</strong> built a global vehicle-sharing community — without owning any cars.</li>
      <li><strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> connect riders and drivers — yet own no vehicles.</li>
      <li><strong>TaskRabbit</strong> and <strong>Fiverr</strong> connect people directly for skills, labor, and services.</li>
      <li><strong>Poshmark</strong> and <strong>Depop</strong> built entire resale economies driven by individual users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Each of these companies redefined ownership and access by putting trust and control back into the hands of everyday people.
      <strong>Baro</strong> is the next step in that evolution — a platform where users can borrow and lend just about anything,
      from tools, recreational gear, electronics, and vehicles to event supplies, instruments, travel items, and more.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      By directly connecting users, we aim to reduce cost, increase access, and bring trade back to the average person —
      making borrowing as natural and reliable as buying.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-center text-green-600">Realistic, Transparent, and User-Driven ⚙️</h2>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      But we’re also realistic: peer-to-peer rentals come with risks. Because every listing is owned and managed by individuals,
      <strong>Baro</strong> can’t guarantee uniform quality, availability, or pricing. This isn’t a substitute for booking through
      commercial vendors when consistency and professional standards are required. Instead, it’s a marketplace driven entirely
      by its users — by trust, transparency, and fair exchange.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Lenders are responsible for pricing their items competitively if they wish them to be borrowed. Borrowers are responsible
      for treating items respectfully and are liable to the lender for the item’s value during the rental period.
      Our role is to make those connections as frictionless, fair, and empowering as possible.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4 text-center text-yellow-600">The Age of Peer-to-Peer Commerce Has Returned 🔁</h2>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-center">
      The age of peer-to-peer commerce has returned — and <strong>Baro</strong> is helping shape its future.
